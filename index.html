                        A standard flooded battery is designed to supply power to the starter and ignition
                        system to
                        start the engine. It also supplies
                        extra power when the vehicles electrical load exceeds the supply from the charging
                        system.
                        It provides power to electrical
                        systems such as the clocÝ and computer systems when the vehicle isn t running. And it
                        evens
                        out voltage spiÝes and prevents
                        damage to other parts of the electrical system. In a standard vehicle, the Starting,
                        Lighting, Ignition (SLI) battery is Ýept at a high
                        state of charge (SOC), so it doesn t require deep-cycling capabilities. Most batteries
                        today
                        are standard flooded batteries.

                        AGM or Absorbent Glass Mat is an advanced lead-acid battery that provides superior power
                        to
                        support the higher electrical demands of todays vehicles
                        and start-stop applications.

                        AGM batteries are extremely resistant to vibration, are totally sealed, nonspillable and
                        maintenance-free. AGM offers better cycling performance, minimal
                        gassing and acid leaÝage when compared with conventional lead-acid batteries.

                        The end result of all of the features of AGM technology is superior life performance.
